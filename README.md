## How to Upload Photos from Your Phone

**GitHub Mobile (easiest)**

1. Open your repo in browser
2. Navigate to `assets/solo/`
3. Tap **Add file → Upload files**
4. Upload your 9 images of yourself
5. Tap each file → Rename → set `1.png`, `2.png`, etc. up to `9.png`
6. Next navigate to `assets/couple`
7. Upload your one image of you and your partner
8. Tap the file → Rename → set `couple.png`

---
## Troubleshooting

### Images not showing
- Filenames must match **exactly**
  - `1.png` not `1.PNG`
  - `couple.png` not `couple.PNG`
- Paths are case-sensitive on GitHub Pages
- Wait ~30 sec after pushing changes

---

### 1. Solo Photos (Captcha Grid)

Upload **9 photos** into the folder:

**assets/solo/**

Name them **exactly**:

1.png

2.png

3.png

4.png

5.png

6.png

7.png

8.png

9.png


These appear **left → right, top → bottom** in the captcha grid.

Photos do **not** need to be square, but square images look best.

---

### 2. Couple Photo (Final Page)

Upload your couple photo to the folder:

**assets/couple/couple.png**

- The image can be any size
- PNG works best (transparency supported but not required)
- It will automatically scale and fit inside the heart

---

## Deploy (Free via GitHub Pages)

1. Go to **Repository Settings → Pages**
2. Under **Build and Deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Save
4. Your site will be live at:

https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/

---

## Notes

- All paths are **case-sensitive** on GitHub Pages.
- Make sure filenames match exactly (`1.png`, not `1.PNG`).
- Works on desktop and mobile.
- No backend required. Fully static site.
